# Teacher-Assistant

a platform where engineers/students undertake guided projects via GitHub repos with skeleton code and progression steps. Imagine a chatbot, leveraging GPT API and langchains, interacting with the repo to answer code-related and domain-related queries, essentially a virtual TA. The platform will also be a community where users can team up and do a guided project together, and can also contribute guided projects to the community that others can complete
